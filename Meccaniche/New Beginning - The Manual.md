# New Beginning

*New Beginning* is a simple **gaming system**, light and elegant, designed for narrative role-playing games; no tables, no calculations, just your story and the courage to take risks—literally. Inspired by *Not the End*, the system revolves around a single dilemma: **how many tokens dare you draw from the bag?**

With just two colors—⚪ white and ⚫ black—each draw determines the fate of the characters: growth, ruin, or transformation. There are no definitive victories or defeats; only the outcome of your actions, accepted and shared by everyone at the table. This makes **emotions and relationships** the true engine of the story.

---

## Materials 🎒

1. **TOKENS**: 6 white (⚪) and 6 black (⚫).
2. A bag for **DRAWING** the **TOKENS**.
3. Character sheets with 8 initial **TRAITS**:
   - 1 **ARCHETYPE**,
   - 3 **QUALITIES** out of 6 available,
   - 4 **SKILLS** out of 12 available.

---

## Facing a Challenge 🎯

> *You face a challenge when your character attempts a significant action, the outcome of which could involve risks, complications, or unexpected turns.*

1. Describe what you want to do.
2. Add **TOKENS** to the (empty) bag:
   - ⚫ equal to the **DIFFICULTY** set by the **NARRATOR**,
   - ⚪ equal to the number of **TRAITS** you choose to put into play.
   - Optional: The **NARRATOR** decides the level of **DANGER**. If you **DRAW** a number of ⚫ equal to or greater than this, the character suffers an **EXIT FROM THE SCENE** (e.g., loses consciousness, is captured, or is temporarily out of play).
3. **DRAW** a number of **TOKENS** of your choice, all at once, blindly.
4. Use the **TOKENS** you **DREW** to have the **NARRATOR** describe the outcome of the **CHALLENGE**.

| DIFFICULTY                                     | Number of ⚫ |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Very easy (make sure it’s necessary)           | 1           |
| Easy                                           | 2           |
| Normal                                         | 3           |
| Difficult                                      | 4           |
| Very difficult                                 | 5           |
| Extremely difficult (better avoid it!)         | 6           |

> **📌 NOTE: The Story Belongs to Everyone**  
> In certain campaigns, you can experiment by letting players *propose* the **COMPLICATIONS** and **MISFORTUNES** they wish to face, within the limits and common sense established by the **NARRATOR**. This approach increases emotional investment and makes the consequences even more personal and meaningful.

---

## Success and Failure 🎭

> *The tokens you drew determine the degree of success or failure of your character’s actions. The Narrator will then interpret how the scene continues based on the context.*

| What you **DREW**                                      | OUTCOME                     | Description                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Only ⚪.                                              | **TOTAL SUCCESS** ✅✅       | You passed the challenge **with flying colors**!                |
| At least 1⚪, and **not** all the ⚫ in the bag.       | **PARTIAL SUCCESS** ✅       | More or less successful based on which **TOKENS** you drew.     |
| At least 1⚪, and **all** the ⚫ in the bag.           | **PARTIAL FAILURE** ❓       | You failed the challenge, but there are **some positives**.     |
| Only ⚫.                                              | **TOTAL FAILURE** ❌         | You failed the challenge **completely**.                        |

---

## Spending Tokens ⚪⚫

> *Once the tokens are drawn, how you choose to spend them helps define the outcome of the challenge and enriches the shared narrative.*

* If you achieved **SUCCESS**, spend:
  - The first ⚪ to pass the **CHALLENGE**.
  - 1 ⚪ to **IMPROVE THE SCENE**.
  - 1 ⚪ and **PLACE IT** on a **TRAIT** used during the **CHALLENGE**, to use it later.

* Spend the ⚫, choosing between:
  - 1 ⚫ to have the **NARRATOR** describe a **COMPLICATION**. An unexpected outcome impacting the **HERO** or the **SCENE** as a whole.
  - 1 ⚫ to have the **NARRATOR** inflict a **MISFORTUNE** (write it on the sheet!). The impact is directly on the **HERO** and affects **CHALLENGES** until remedied or the effects wear off.

> 📌 **NOTE: Success Is Not Guaranteed**  
> Remember: drawing tokens is always a gamble. If you draw a number of tokens equal to or fewer than the ⚫ in the bag, you risk drawing *only* ⚫ and failing completely. But beware: even drawing more tokens, you might still draw *all* the ⚫ and face a partial failure. The choice is yours, and the risk is real.

> 📌 **NOTE: Investing in the Future**  
> You can spend 1 ⚪ to place it on a Trait used in this challenge, as a "reserve" for the future. Remember: you can use *at most one* placed token per challenge, and each trait can hold *at most one* token. It’s a precious resource: use it wisely!

# Other Rules

> *So far, we’ve covered the core rules of the system. The following sections introduce additional elements to make the gaming experience richer and more engaging.*

---

## Thematic Statuses ⚗️

> *To adjust the difficulty of challenges, the Narrator can apply a thematic status to the character before tokens are drawn.*

Before facing a **CHALLENGE**, the **NARRATOR** may choose to **apply** a **STATUS**. You can make suggestions, but the **NARRATOR** decides whether and what to apply. Here are some examples:

| Positive Statuses 😃 | Effect                                                                      | Flavor                                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CONFIDENT**       | **DRAWING** all the ⚫ in the bag doesn’t count as **PARTIAL FAILURE**.      | *The challenge is easy, and you’re very sure of yourself.*          |
| **OPTIMISM**        | If you **DRAW** a single **TOKEN** and **FAIL**, you can **DRAW** again.    | *It’s your first try, but it’ll be fine...*                        |
| **FOCUS**           | If you choose to **DRAW** one **TOKEN**, ⚪ counts as 2.                    | *You’re focused on a goal that tests your mind.*                   |
| **INSPIRATION**     | If you **IMPROVE THE SCENE**, you can suggest a detail to the **NARRATOR**. | *A sudden idea guides you toward success.*                         |

| Negative Statuses 😨         | Effect                                                                          | Flavor                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ADRENALINE**              | **DRAW** all **TOKENS** except one.                                            | *In this physical challenge, your fight-or-flight instinct kicks in!*         |
| **CONFUSION**               | A ⚫ you **DRAW** counts as 2.                                                 | *In a hectic moment, you don’t have time to think...*                        |
| **FEAR**                    | You must spend 2⚪ to pass the challenge.                                      | *You’re scared, and your decisions are clouded.*                             |
| **DISTRACTION** / **FATIGUE** | You cannot use more than 2 **TRAITS** in this challenge, even if you have more. | *Something distracts you, making it hard to use all your abilities.*         |

---

## Crucial Challenge 🏆

> *In this system, a character’s traits generally remain static throughout the campaign. This section explores how to enrich the character with special abilities and new traits. A crucial challenge is a special event that causes inner growth for the character.*

You face a **CRUCIAL CHALLENGE** when you deem it pivotal to the **HERO**’s development.

1. Declare the **CRUCIAL CHALLENGE** at any point before **DRAWING**.
2. Face the **CHALLENGE** normally.
3. Choose **one of these** options based on the outcome of the **CHALLENGE**:
   - **NEW TRAIT**: Add a new **TRAIT** to your sheet, consistent with the experience.
   - **IMPROVE A TRAIT**: Increase the level of a **TRAIT** used in the challenge (e.g., from “Persuasive” to “Persuasive II”). Using that trait grants 1 extra ⚪.
   - Learn a **LESSON**: A new skill gained from a crucial experience, providing beneficial effects in specific narrative contexts.
   - If you fail, gain a **SCAR**: A mark left by a significant traumatic event, offering versatile effects in narrative contexts related to the challenge.

---

## Lending a Hand ✋

> *Characters can join forces to face a challenge, sharing resources and risks to achieve a common goal.*

If you face a **CHALLENGE**, other **HEROES** or **SUPPORTING CHARACTERS** with a relevant **TRAIT** can choose to **COLLABORATE**. Each collaborator adds 1⚪ to the bag and describes how they contribute. However, each collaborator risks suffering a **COMPLICATION** or **MISFORTUNE** if ⚫ are drawn. Alternatively, the group can declare a **GROUP CHALLENGE**:

- One player leads the challenge, describing the collective action.
- Each participant adds 1⚪ for a relevant trait (up to 6⚪ available).
- The Narrator increases the **DIFFICULTY** by 1⚫ for each collaborator **beyond the first**.
- The leader **DRAWS** the tokens and spends the ⚪; the ⚫ apply to the whole group or a single member, at the Narrator’s discretion.

---

# Tips for the Narrator

> *The Narrator is the director of the story, responsible for balancing risk, drama, and reward to create an engaging experience.*

- **Setting the Difficulty**: Use the Difficulty table as a guide, but consider the campaign’s tone. A “Very difficult” challenge (5⚫) should be rare and reserved for climactic moments. Adjust the Difficulty based on the number of traits used by players to maintain the dilemma.
- **Applying Danger**: Use Danger to heighten tension, but clarify the outcome of an **EXIT FROM THE SCENE** (e.g., temporary or narrative). Avoid lethal outcomes unless they fit the story.
- **Thematic Statuses**: Apply Statuses to reflect the environment or the hero’s mental state, making the choice of how many **TOKENS** to **DRAW** more interesting. Use custom Statuses for unique events (e.g., “Fatigue” during a long march).
- **Balancing Complications and Misfortunes**: Complications should push the story forward (e.g., a new obstacle), while Misfortunes should challenge the hero without stopping them. Collaborate with players to make consequences meaningful but not punitive.
- **Shared Narrative**: Encourage players to suggest details for Complications or Scene Improvements, but retain final say for consistency.

#### Examples of Spending Tokens

| Mechanic            | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IMPROVE THE SCENE  | *"Your arrow not only hits the center of the target but splits the previous arrow in two. The crowd goes wild!"*                                                                                                                                           |
| COMPLICATION       | *"You were fishing on your little boat with friends when a sudden storm hits. It’s a race against time to reach safety."*                                                                                                                                    |
| MISFORTUNE         | *"At the archery tournament, attended by family and friends, you make a fool of yourself..."* <br><br>You gain “Wounded Pride.” Archery challenges receive +1⚫. <br>Place the ⚫ spent for this **MISFORTUNE** on the character sheet. The number of ⚫ indicates its severity. You must pass a CHALLENGE that justifies removing this **MISFORTUNE**. |

#### Example of Danger

*You’re climbing the manor’s wall on a rainy night to sneak in unnoticed.*

Difficulty **3⚫** (normal), you use **2⚪** for the traits *Climber* and *Agile*. The Narrator sets **DANGER = 2** (if **≥2⚫ drawn**, an **EXIT FROM THE SCENE** occurs).

**Bag:** ⚪⚪⚫⚫⚫  
You decide to **DRAW 3 TOKENS**.  
**Outcome:** **⚪⚫⚫ →** you pass the challenge, but the **DANGER** triggers: you grab the gutter, which **gives way**, causing you to fall into the courtyard. **Exit from the Scene**: you’re captured by guards and end up in the dungeon (you’ll return in the next scene).

#### Example of Group Challenge

*Three companions want to **break down** a barred door as mercenaries approach.*

It’s a **Group Challenge**: one leads, the others contribute.  
Difficulty **2⚫** (*easy*). **3** participate: each adds **1⚪**; the Narrator **increases the Difficulty by +1⚫ for each collaborator beyond the first** → total **4⚫**. **Whites:** 3⚪. **Blacks:** 4⚫. The leader **DRAWS** and spends the ⚪ for the group.

**Bag:** ⚪⚪⚪⚫⚫⚫⚫  
The leader decides to **DRAW 3 TOKENS**.  
**Possible Outcome:** **⚪⚪⚫ →** **partial success**: the door gives way. **COMPLICATION**: the hinges fly off, and one character **injures** their arm, gaining a light **Misfortune**; the **NARRATOR** may apply it to the group or a single member.

#### Examples of Lesson and Scar

The **LESSON** and **SCAR** are similar to **TRAITS** with effects applicable in **CHALLENGES** related to the **CRUCIAL CHALLENGE** from which they originated. Here are some examples:

| Name                        | Effect                                                                                     | Flavor                                                        |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LESSON**: Perseverance   | If you **FAIL COMPLETELY** in a **CHALLENGE** assigned by a superior, you can **DRAW** 1 more **TOKEN**. | *"You’ve learned never to give up in the face of failure."*  |
| **SCAR**: Wisdom           | If you **FAIL** a **CHALLENGE** involving your vast experience, you can spend 1⚫ to **PLACE IT** on a used trait. | *"You’ve gained wisdom and a new perspective on life."*      |

#### Examples of Improving a Trait

| Trait        | Level 2              | Level 3               | Level 4                  |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Persuasive   | Persuasive II        | -                     | -                        |
| Intuitive    | Sixth Sense II       | -                     | -                        |
| Stealthy     | Silent Shadow II     | Urban Phantom III     | -                        |
| Climber      | Climber II           | Expert Climber III    | -                        |
| Brute Force  | Iron Muscles II      | Controlled Fury III   | Unstoppable Colossus IV  |

# **Now It’s Your Turn ✨**

You’ve read the rules. You’ve grasped the heart of the game: the risk, the choice, the shared narrative. You hold an elegant tool made of white and black tokens, traits, scars, and lessons learned. However, these pages are not an instruction manual to follow to the letter. They are a map, an invitation. An invitation to create something alive, unpredictable, yours.

**Don’t seek perfection. Seek emotion.**  
Let the complications surprise you.  
Let the successes thrill you.  
Let the misfortunes shape you.  
*New Beginning* isn’t a system that tells you what to do. It’s a system that asks: *“How much do you dare to risk?”* Every ⚪ you put in the bag is a part of you, your character, your story. Every ⚫ you draw is an opportunity to turn failure into drama, defeat into a new beginning.

The Narrator has their role, the players theirs. But the story? The story is born *between* you, in the moment you decide how many tokens to draw, when you accept a misfortune because “yes, it makes sense for my character,” when someone says, “What if instead…?”

Now take your characters, the bag, your courage, and begin. Your story awaits!

> *“It’s not the end. It’s a new beginning.”*
