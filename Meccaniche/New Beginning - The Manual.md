# New Beginning


*New Beginning* is a simple **game system**, lightweight and elegant, designed for narrative role-playing games; no tables, no calculations, just your story and the courage to take risks‚Äîliterally. Inspired by *Not the End*, the system revolves around a single dilemma: **how many tokens dare you draw from the bag?**

With just two colors‚Äî‚ö™ white and ‚ö´ black‚Äîeach draw determines the fate of the characters: growth, ruin, or transformation. There are no definitive victories or defeats; only the outcome of your actions, accepted and shared by everyone at the table. This makes **emotions and relationships** the true engine of the story.

## Materials üéí

1. **TOKENS**: 6 white (‚ö™) and 6 black (‚ö´).
    
2. A bag for **DRAWING** the **TOKENS**.
    
3. Character sheets with 8 initial **TRAITS**:
     
    - 1 **ARCHETYPE**,
    
    - 3 **QUALITIES** out of 6 available,
    
    - 4 **SKILLS** out of 12 available.

## Facing a Trial üéØ

> *You face a trial when your character attempts a significant action, the outcome of which could involve risks, complications, or unexpected turns.*

1. Describe what you want to do.
    
2. Add **TOKENS** to the (empty) bag:
     
    - ‚ö´ equal to the **DIFFICULTY** decided by the **NARRATOR**,
    
    - ‚ö™ equal to the number of **TRAITS** you choose to put into play.
    
    - Optional: The **NARRATOR** decides the level of **DANGER**. If you **DRAW** a number of ‚ö´ equal to or greater than this, the character suffers an **EXIT FROM THE SCENE** (e.g., loses consciousness, is captured, or is temporarily out of play).
    
3. **DRAW** a number of **TOKENS** of your choice, all at once.
    
4. Use the **TOKENS** you‚Äôve **DRAWN** to have the **NARRATOR** describe the outcome of the **TRIAL**.

| DIFFICULTY                                   | Number of ‚ö´ |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Very easy (make sure <br>it‚Äôs necessary)     | 1           |
| Easy                                         | 2           |
| Normal                                       | 3           |
| Difficult                                    | 4           |
| Very difficult                               | 5           |
| Extremely difficult<br>(better not!)          | 6           |

> **üìå NOTE: The Story Belongs to Everyone**  
> In certain campaigns, you can experiment by letting players propose the **COMPLICATIONS** and **MISFORTUNES** they wish to face, within the limits and common sense set by the **NARRATOR**. This approach increases emotional investment and makes consequences even more personal and meaningful.

---

## Success and Failure üé≠

> *The tokens you draw determine the degree of success or failure of your character‚Äôs actions. The Narrator will then interpret how the scene continues based on the context.*

| What you **DREW**                                          | OUTCOME                      | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Only ‚ö™.                                                   | **TOTAL SUCCESS** ‚úÖ‚úÖ        | You passed the trial<br>**with flying colors**!                 |
| At least 1 ‚ö™, and **not** all the ‚ö´ <br>in the bag.       | **PARTIAL SUCCESS** ‚úÖ       | More or less successful based<br>on which **TOKENS** you drew.  |
| At least 1 ‚ö™, and **all** the ‚ö´ <br>in the bag.           | **PARTIAL FAILURE** ‚ùì       | You failed the trial,<br>but there are **positive aspects**.    |
| Only ‚ö´.                                                   | **TOTAL FAILURE** ‚ùå         | You failed the trial<br>**completely**.                         |

---

## Spending Tokens ‚ö™‚ö´

> *Once you‚Äôve drawn the tokens, how you choose to spend them helps define the outcome of the trial and enriches the shared narrative.*

* If you achieved **SUCCESS**, spend:
    
    - The first ‚ö™ to pass the **TRIAL**.
    
    - 1 ‚ö™ to **IMPROVE THE SCENE**.
    
    - 1 ‚ö™ and **PLACE IT** on a **TRAIT** used during the **TRIAL**, to use it later.
    
* Spend the ‚ö´, choosing between:
    
    - 1 ‚ö´ to have the **NARRATOR** describe a **COMPLICATION**. An unexpected outcome, impacting the **HERO** or the **SCENE** as a whole.
    
    - 1 ‚ö´ to have the **NARRATOR** inflict a **MISFORTUNE** (write it on the sheet!). The impact is direct on the **HERO** and affects the **TRIALS** you face until it‚Äôs resolved or its effects wear off.

> üìå **NOTE: Success Is Not Guaranteed**  
> Remember: drawing tokens is always a gamble. If you draw a number of tokens equal to or fewer than the ‚ö´ in the bag, you risk drawing *only* ‚ö´ and failing completely. But beware: even drawing more tokens, you might still draw *all* the ‚ö´ and face a partial failure. The choice is yours, and the risk is real.

> üìå **NOTE: Investing in the Future**  
> You can spend 1 ‚ö™ to place it on a Trait used in this trial as a ‚Äúreserve‚Äù for the future. Remember: in any trial, you can use *at most one* placed token, and each trait can hold *at most one* token. It‚Äôs a valuable resource: use it wisely!

## Other Rules

> *So far, we‚Äôve covered the core rules of the system. The following sections introduce additional elements to make the gaming experience richer and more engaging.*

---

## Thematic Statuses ‚öóÔ∏è

> *To modulate the difficulty of trials, the Narrator can apply a thematic status to the character before tokens are drawn.*

Before facing a **TRIAL**, the **NARRATOR** may choose to **apply** a **STATUS**. You can suggest ideas, but the **NARRATOR** decides whether and what to apply. Here are some examples:

| Positive Statuses üòÉ | Effect                                                                     | Flavor                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CONFIDENT**       | **DRAWING** all the ‚ö´ in the bag doesn‚Äôt count as **PARTIAL FAILURE**.     | *The trial is easy, and you‚Äôre very sure of yourself.*              |
| **OPTIMISM**        | If you **DRAW** only one **TOKEN** and **FAIL**, you can **DRAW** again.   | *It‚Äôs your first try, but it‚Äôll all work out‚Ä¶*                     |
| **FOCUS**           | If you choose to **DRAW** only one **TOKEN**, ‚ö™ count as 2.                | *You‚Äôre focused on a goal that tests your mind.*                   |
| **INSPIRATION**     | If you **IMPROVE THE SCENE**, you can suggest a detail to the **NARRATOR**. | *A sudden idea guides you to success.*                             |

| Negative Statuses üò®         | Effect                                                                          | Flavor                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ADRENALINE**              | **DRAW** all **TOKENS** except one.                                             | *In this physical trial, your fight-or-flight instinct kicks in!*             |
| **CONFUSION**               | One ‚ö´ you **DRAW** counts as 2.                                                | *In a hectic moment, you don‚Äôt have time to think‚Ä¶*                          |
| **FEAR**                    | You must spend 2 ‚ö™ to pass the trial.                                          | *You‚Äôre scared, your decisions are clouded.*                                 |
| **DISTRACTION** / **FATIGUE** | You can‚Äôt use more than 2 **TRAITS** in this trial, even if you have more.      | *Something distracts you, making it hard to use all your abilities.*         |

---

## Crucial Trial üèÜ

> *In this system, character traits generally remain static throughout the campaign. This section explores how to enrich the character with special abilities and new traits. The Crucial Trial is a special event that causes inner growth for the character.*

You face a **CRUCIAL TRIAL** when you consider it pivotal for the development of the **HERO**.

1. Declare the **CRUCIAL TRIAL** at any time before **DRAWING**.
    
2. Face the **TRIAL** as normal.
    
3. Choose **one of these** options based on the outcome of the **TRIAL**:
    
    - **NEW TRAIT**: Add a new **TRAIT** to your sheet, consistent with the experience.
    
    - **IMPROVE A TRAIT**: Increase the level of a **TRAIT** used in the trial (e.g., from ‚ÄúPersuasive‚Äù to ‚ÄúPersuasive II‚Äù). Using that trait gives you 1 extra ‚ö™.
    
    - Learn a **LESSON**: A new skill gained through a crucial experience; it provides beneficial effects in specific narrative contexts.
    
    - If you fail, gain a **SCAR**: A mark left by a significant traumatic event; it provides versatile effects in narrative contexts related to the trial.

---

## Lending a Hand ‚úã

> *Characters can join forces to face a trial, sharing resources and risks to achieve a common goal.*

If you face a **TRIAL**, other **HEROES** or **SUPPORTING CHARACTERS** with a relevant **TRAIT** can choose to **COLLABORATE**. Each collaborator adds 1 ‚ö™ to the bag and describes how they contribute. However, each collaborator risks suffering a **COMPLICATION** or **MISFORTUNE** if ‚ö´ are drawn. Alternatively, the group can declare a **GROUP TRIAL**:

- One player leads the trial, describing the collective action.
    
- Each participant adds 1 ‚ö™ for a relevant trait (remember, you have up to 6 ‚ö™ available).
    
- The Narrator increases the **DIFFICULTY** by 1 ‚ö´ for each collaborator **beyond the first**.
    
- The leader **DRAWS** the tokens and spends the ‚ö™; the ‚ö´ apply to the entire group or a single member, at the Narrator‚Äôs discretion.

---

## Tips for the Narrator

> *The Narrator is the director of the story, responsible for balancing risk, drama, and reward to create an engaging experience.*

- **Setting the Difficulty**: Use the Difficulty table as a guide, but consider the campaign‚Äôs tone. A ‚ÄúVery difficult‚Äù trial (5 ‚ö´) should be rare and reserved for climactic moments. Adjust the Difficulty based on the number of traits used by players to maintain the dilemma.
    
- **Applying Danger**: Use Danger to heighten tension, but clarify the outcome of an **EXIT FROM THE SCENE** (e.g., temporary or narrative). Avoid lethal outcomes unless they‚Äôre consistent with the story.
    
- **Thematic Statuses**: Apply Statuses to reflect the environment or the hero‚Äôs mental state, making the choice of how many **TOKENS** to **DRAW** more interesting. Use custom Statuses for unique events (e.g., ‚ÄúFatigue‚Äù during a long march).
    
- **Balancing Complications and Misfortunes**: Complications should push the story forward (e.g., a new obstacle), while Misfortunes should challenge the hero without stopping them. Collaborate with players to make consequences meaningful but not punitive.
    
- **Shared Narrative**: Encourage players to suggest details for Complications or Scene Improvements, but retain the final say for consistency.

## Examples

#### Examples of Success and Failure

| TOKENS in the Bag | TOKENS DRAWN | Outcome                     |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| ‚ö™‚ö™‚ö™‚ö´             | ‚ö™‚ö™          | **TOTAL SUCCESS** ‚≠êÔ∏è        |
| ‚ö™‚ö´‚ö´              | ‚ö™‚ö´          | **PARTIAL SUCCESS** ‚úÖ       |
| ‚ö™‚ö™‚ö´              | ‚ö™‚ö´          | **PARTIAL FAILURE** ‚ùì       |
| ‚ö™‚ö™‚ö´‚ö´             | ‚ö´           | **TOTAL FAILURE** ‚ùå         |

#### Example of a Misfortune

*"It seems the bartender didn‚Äôt appreciate your comment about his round figure..."*  
- You‚Äôll receive 1 extra ‚ö´ difficulty for certain trials that take place in the aforementioned bar.  
- Befriend the bartender to remove this **MISFORTUNE**.

#### Example of Danger

*"You‚Äôre climbing the manor‚Äôs wall on a rainy night to sneak in unnoticed."*  

Difficulty **3 ‚ö´** (normal), you use **2 ‚ö™** for the traits *Climber* and *Agile*. The Narrator sets **DANGER = 2** (with **‚â•2 ‚ö´ drawn**, an **EXIT FROM THE SCENE** occurs).

**Bag:** ‚ö™‚ö™‚ö´‚ö´‚ö´  
You decide to **DRAW 3** **TOKENS**.  
**Outcome:** **‚ö™‚ö´‚ö´ ‚Üí** you pass the trial, but the **DANGER** triggers: you grab the gutter, which **collapses**, causing you to fall into the courtyard. **Exit from the Scene**: you‚Äôre captured by the guards and end up in the dungeon (you‚Äôll return in the next scene).

#### Example of a Group Trial

*Three companions want to **break down** a barred door as mercenaries approach.*

It‚Äôs a **Group Trial**: one leads, the others contribute.  
Difficulty **2 ‚ö´** (*easy*). There are **3** participants: each adds **1 ‚ö™**; the Narrator **increases the Difficulty by +1 ‚ö´ for each collaborator beyond the first** ‚Üí total **4 ‚ö´**. **Whites:** 3 ‚ö™. **Blacks:** 4 ‚ö´. The leader **DRAWS** and spends the ‚ö™ for the group.

**Bag:** ‚ö™‚ö™‚ö™‚ö´‚ö´‚ö´‚ö´  
The leader decides to **DRAW 3** tokens.  
**Possible Outcome:** **‚ö™‚ö™‚ö´ ‚Üí** **partial success**: the door gives way. **COMPLICATION**: the hinges fly off, and one character **injures** their arm, suffering a minor **Misfortune**; the **NARRATOR** may apply it to the group or a single member.

#### Examples of Lesson and Scar

**LESSONS** and **SCARS** are similar to **TRAITS** with effects applicable in **TRIALS** related to the **CRUCIAL TRIAL** from which they originated. Here are some examples:

| LESSON                     | Flavor                                                                      | Effect                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dream Team                 | *"You‚Äôve learned that the real treasure is your friends‚Ä¶ or something like that."* | Add 1 ‚ö™ to the bag.                                                                                     |
| The Supermoon              | *"During a full moon night..."*                                             | Add 2 ‚ö™ to the bag.                                                                                     |
| Perseverance               | *"You‚Äôve learned never to give up in the face of failure."*                 | If you‚Äôre about to fail, you can choose to draw another TOKEN.                                          |
| Lucky After All            | *"When things don‚Äôt go as planned, there‚Äôs a lesson to learn."*             | If you fail partially, you can still PLACE 1 ‚ö™ on a TRAIT used in the trial.                           |
| Seer                       | *"Some call it luck, but you know they‚Äôre wrong."*                          | Predict the number of ‚ö™ you‚Äôll DRAW. If you‚Äôre correct, ‚ö™ beyond the first can be spent twice.          |
| Thrift                     | *"Every penny counts, and you guard them carefully."*                       | Remove one TOKEN from the bag to place it on a TRAIT of your choice.                                    |
| Order                      | *"You love routine and keeping everything in order."*                       | BURN 2 ‚ö™ and 1 ‚ö´ from the bag.                                                                         |

| SCAR                       | Flavor                                                                      | Effect                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tough                      | *"You‚Äôve gained wisdom and a new perspective on life."*                     | If you **FAIL** a **TRIAL**, you can spend 1 ‚ö´ to **PLACE IT** on a **TRAIT** you used.                |
| Quick Thinking             | *"No time to waste‚Ä¶ make a decision without thinking twice."*               | You can retry the draw, but unless it‚Äôs a total success, you receive 1 extra ‚ö´.                        |
| Persistent                 | *"You never give up‚Ä¶ EVER."*                                               | Return 1 ‚ö´ you drew to the bag, then draw another TOKEN.                                               |
| Divide and Conquer         | *"Your ambition is to conquer and control."*                                | After drawing, you can swap drawn TOKENS with those still in the bag, but you must spend the ‚ö´ you drew. |
| Over the Top               | *"Going overboard isn‚Äôt a flaw; it‚Äôs your trademark."*                      | Draw all TOKENS except one. If you fail, you can return 1 ‚ö´ to the bag, but ‚ö™ beyond the first don‚Äôt count. |
| Cautious                   | *"After last time, you‚Äôll never take unnecessary risks again‚Ä¶"*             | BURN all ‚ö™ and all ‚ö´ except one.                                                                       |
| Control Freak              | *"You love giving orders, and others better follow them‚Ä¶"*                  | If you passed the trial, spend 1 ‚ö™; you can PLACE as many ‚ö™ and ‚ö´ as possible on traits used in the trial. |

#### Examples of Improving a Trait

# **Now It‚Äôs Your Turn ‚ú®**

You‚Äôve read the rules. You‚Äôve grasped the heart of the game: the risk, the choice, the shared narrative. You hold in your hands an elegant tool, made of white and black tokens, traits, scars, and lessons learned. However, these pages are not an instruction manual to follow to the letter. They are a map, an invitation. An invitation to create something alive, unpredictable, and yours.

**Don‚Äôt seek perfection. Seek emotion.**  
Let complications surprise you.  
Let successes thrill you.  
Let misfortunes shape you.  
*New Beginning* isn‚Äôt a system that tells you what to do. It‚Äôs a system that asks: *‚ÄúHow much do you dare to risk?‚Äù* Every ‚ö™ you put in the bag is a piece of you, your character, your story. Every ‚ö´ you draw is an opportunity to turn failure into drama, defeat into a new beginning.

The Narrator has their role, the players theirs. But the story? The story is born *between* you, in the moment you decide how many tokens to draw, when you accept a misfortune because ‚Äúyes, it makes sense for my character,‚Äù when someone says, ‚ÄúWhat if instead‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Now take your characters, the bag, your courage, and begin. Your story awaits nothing else!

> *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the end. It‚Äôs just a new beginning.‚Äù*
