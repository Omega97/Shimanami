# New Beginning

**New Beginning** is a simple, light, and elegant game system designed for narrative role‑playing games—no tables, no calculations, just your story and the courage to take a literal risk. Inspired by *Not the End*, the system revolves around a single dilemma: **how many tokens dare you draw from the bag?**

With only two colors—⚪ white and ⚫ black—every draw shapes your character’s fate: growth, ruin, or transformation. There are no definitive victories or defeats; only the consequences of your actions, accepted and shared by everyone at the table. This makes emotions and relationships the true engine of the story.

## Core Rules

### Materials 🎒
- **TOKENS**: 6 white (⚪) and 6 black (⚫).  
- A **bag** for drawing tokens.  
- **Character sheets** with 8 starting **TRAITS**:  
  - 1 **ARCHETYPE** (defines who your hero is and their role in the world)  
  - 3 **QUALITIES** (personal, emotional, or moral characteristics)  
  - 4 **SKILLS** (practical, technical, or professional competencies)  

> [Character Sheet Template](https://github.com/Omega97/Shimanami/blob/main/Meccaniche/_template_character_sheet_NB.pdf)  
> Includes: character name, description, TRAITS, possessions, LESSONS, and AFFLICTIONS.

### Facing a Trial 🎯

You face a **Trial** whenever your character attempts a meaningful action whose outcome might involve risks, complications, or unexpected turning points.

1. **Describe** what you want to do.  
2. **Build the bag**:  
   - Add ⚫ equal to the **DIFFICULTY** set by the NARRATOR.  
   - Add ⚪ equal to the number of **helpful TRAITS** you choose to commit.  
   - Optionally, add 1 ⚫ for each **harmful TRAIT** that works against you.  
3. *(Optional)* The NARRATOR may declare a **DANGER LEVEL**. If you draw a number of ⚫ **equal to or greater than** this level, your character suffers a **SCENE EXIT** (e.g., knocked unconscious, captured, or temporarily out of play).  
4. **Draw** any number of tokens you wish—all at once, blindly.  
5. Use the drawn tokens to let the **NARRATOR** describe the outcome of the Trial.

| Difficulty       | Black Tokens (⚫) |
|------------------|------------------|
| Very Easy (only if truly necessary) | 1 |
| Easy             | 2 |
| Normal           | 3 |
| Hard             | 4 |
| Very Hard        | 5 |
| Extremely Hard (better not!) | 6 |

📌 **NOTE**: **The Story Belongs to Everyone**  
In certain campaigns, you can experiment by letting players propose the complications or afflictions they’re willing to endure—within limits and common sense agreed upon with the Narrator. This increases emotional investment and makes consequences deeply personal and meaningful.

📌 **NOTE**: The bag can hold **up to 6 ⚪ and 6 ⚫**, for a total of **12 tokens**.

---

### Success and Failure 🎭

The tokens you draw determine the degree of success or failure. The Narrator then interprets how the scene continues, based on context.

| What You Drew                     | Outcome               | Description |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Only ⚪                          | **FULL SUCCESS** ✅✅  | You ace the Trial! |
| At least 1 ⚪, and **not all** ⚫ in the bag | **PARTIAL SUCCESS** ✅ | Varies based on which tokens you drew. |
| At least 1 ⚪, and **all** ⚫ in the bag | **PARTIAL FAILURE** ❓ | You failed the Trial, but there are silver linings. |
| Only ⚫                          | **TOTAL FAILURE** ❌   | You failed completely. |

---

### Spending Tokens ⚪⚫

Once drawn, how you spend your tokens helps shape the outcome and enriches shared storytelling.

**If you succeeded**, spend:
- 1 ⚪ to **pass the Trial**,
- Additional ⚪ to **enhance the scene**, or  
- ⚪ to **place them on a TRAIT** used in the Trial, saving them for future use.

**Spend all drawn ⚫** by choosing one or more of the following:
- 1 ⚫ per **COMPLICATION**: an unexpected twist with immediate impact on your hero or the scene.
- 1 or more ⚫ for an **AFFLICTION**: a lasting consequence that affects your hero long-term, adding difficulty to future Trials until resolved.

| Trial Phase        | Possible Actions |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Description        | Describe the Trial you're attempting. |
| Building the Bag   | - Narrator sets Difficulty (⚫)<br>- Player adds ⚪ based on helpful TRAITS<br>- Narrator may add ⚫ for harmful TRAITS |
| Drawing            | Draw as many tokens as you like. |
| Outcome Check      | Determine success or failure. If successful, spend 1 ⚪. |
| Spending Tokens    | Decide how to spend drawn tokens. |
| Outcome Narration  | Narrator describes the result, including any complications or afflictions. |

📌 **NOTE**: **Success Is Never Guaranteed**  
Remember: drawing tokens is always a gamble. If you draw a number of tokens **equal to or fewer than** the ⚫ in the bag, you risk pulling only ⚫ and failing completely. Even drawing more doesn’t guarantee safety—you might still pull all ⚫ and suffer a partial failure. The choice is yours, and the risk is real.

📌 **NOTE**: **Invest in the Future**  
You may spend 1 ⚪ to **place it on a TRAIT** used in this Trial as a "reserve" for later.  
- In any future Trial, you may use **at most one stored token**.  
- Each TRAIT can hold **only one stored token**.  
Use this precious resource wisely!

### Trial Modifiers

#### Thematic Statuses ⚗️

To fine‑tune difficulty and add narrative depth, the Narrator may apply a **Thematic Status** before tokens are drawn.

Before a Trial, the Narrator may assign a **STATUS** to your character. You may suggest one, but the Narrator decides whether and what to apply.

| Status             | Effect                                      | Flavor |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| **OPTIMISM** 😃    | If you’re about to **FAIL**, you may draw **one extra token**. | The Trial feels easy—you’re full of confidence. |
| **ADRENALINE / FEAR** 😨 | Draw **all tokens except one**. | You’re terrified! Fight-or-flight kicks in. |
| **CONFUSION** 😵‍💫 | You must spend **2 ⚪** to succeed at the Trial. | Your thoughts are muddled—no time to think clearly. |
| **DISTRACTION / FATIGUE** 😮‍💨 | You may use **at most 2 TRAITS** in this Trial. | Something is draining you—mentally or physically. |

#### Danger ❗️

Every bold action carries a shadow of risk. When the Narrator declares **Danger**, your hero’s fate hangs by a thread: a bad draw may trigger a **Scene Exit**, a dramatic moment that shifts the story’s course.

- Before drawing, the Narrator announces a **Danger Level**: the minimum number of ⚪ you must draw to **avoid a Scene Exit**.
- After the Trial, if the number of ⚪ you drew is:
  - **Less than** the Danger Level → Scene Exit (collaboratively narrated).
  - **Equal to or greater than** the Danger Level → your hero stays in the scene.

| ⚪ Drawn | Danger Level |
|--------|--------------|
| 0      | None         |
| 1      | Low          |
| 2      | Medium       |
| 3      | High         |
| …      | —            |
| # of ⚪ in bag | Maximum |

##### **Scene Exit**
A **Scene Exit** is a dramatic moment where your hero is temporarily taken out of play due to Danger (drawing ⚫ ≥ Danger Level). You might lose consciousness, be captured, or face an insurmountable obstacle.  
This is **not permanent defeat**—you return in the next scene, often with an **Affliction** or a new narrative hook. Work with the Narrator to make this moment meaningful and story‑driving.

📌 **NOTE**: **Calibrate Risk Wisely**  
Use Danger sparingly—reserve it for crucial moments or high‑tension scenes. The Danger Level should reflect the Trial’s intensity. Avoid extreme outcomes unless they align with the campaign’s tone. Danger isn’t punishment—it’s an invitation to intensify the story.

### Character Evolution

#### Crucial Trial 🏆

In this system, character traits generally remain static. **Crucial Trials** are special moments that spark inner growth.

You may declare a **Crucial Trial** when you feel it’s pivotal to your hero’s journey—**before drawing tokens**.

After resolving the Trial normally, choose **one** of the following:

- **NEW TRAIT**: Add a new TRAIT reflecting the experience. If you failed, let it echo that failure (e.g., “Distrustful”).
- **IMPROVE A TRAIT**: If you succeeded, upgrade a used TRAIT (e.g., “Persuasive” → “Persuasive II”), granting +1 ⚪ when used.
- **LEARN A LESSON**: Gain a new narrative ability tied to the Trial’s context. If you failed, the Lesson should reflect that weight.

> If you **failed** the Crucial Trial, you’re marked by a significant trauma—**spend at least 1 ⚫ on an Affliction**.

📌 **NOTE**:  
The Narrator decides whether a Trial qualifies as Crucial, considering campaign length. Aim for a limited number of Crucial Trials.  
Each **Lesson** can be used **once per session**.

---

#### Lessons ⚪️

Each Crucial Trial is a crossroads—a moment that forever changes your hero. Whether you triumph or fall, what you learn makes you different: wiser, stronger… or more scarred. A **Lesson** is the fruit of that experience—a narrative gift that enriches your path.

After a Crucial Trial, you may gain a **Lesson**: a skill or insight reflecting what transpired. Lessons aren’t just abilities—they’re story fragments that define who you are and how you face the world.

**How it works**:
- Create a Lesson **with the Narrator**, tied to the Trial’s outcome and context.
- Give it an evocative name and a specific effect.
- Use it **once per session** in a relevant Trial.

> If you **failed**, the Lesson should carry the weight of that failure—perhaps granting an advantage at a cost (e.g., +1 ⚫). If you **succeeded**, let it celebrate your hero.

📌 **NOTE**: Collaborate to craft Lessons that deepen narrative, not guarantee success. A Lesson born from failure might come with a price; one from success should elevate your hero.

---

#### Afflictions ⚫️

You may choose to spend one or more drawn ⚫ to receive an **Affliction** from the Narrator.

**To create an Affliction**:
1. **Record it** on your sheet, noting its **level** (number of ⚫ spent).
2. **Personalize it**: Work with the Narrator to name and describe it based on the Trial.
3. **Effect**: The Affliction adds ⚫ equal to its level to **relevant future Trials**.
4. **Resolution**: Remove it through a narrative action or specific Trial. Some fade with time, at the Narrator’s discretion.

---

### Group Play

#### Helping Out ✋

Characters can combine efforts, sharing resources and risks.

- If you face a Trial, other **HEROES** or **SUPPORTING CHARACTERS** with a relevant TRAIT may **ASSIST**.
  - Each assistant adds **1 ⚪** to the bag and describes how they help.
  - **Difficulty increases by 1 ⚫** for each assistant **after the first**.
  - Assistants **risk Complications or Afflictions** if ⚫ are drawn.

#### Group Trial

- One player **leads** the Trial, describing the collective action.
- Each participant adds **1 ⚪** per relevant TRAIT (max 6 ⚪ total).
- Narrator increases **Difficulty by 1 ⚫ per assistant beyond the first**.
- The **leader draws** tokens and spends ⚪; ⚫ affect the **whole group** or a chosen member (Narrator’s call).

#### Player Conflict 🏹

When characters clash—over ideals, pride, or interests—choose one of two approaches:

**OPTION 1: Single Trial**  
Use when you want to preserve mystery or treat the other player as “just another NPC.”
- Only one player rolls.
- Add ⚫ equal to the number of **opposing/helpful TRAITS** of the other character.
- The other player remains “invisible” to mechanics.

**OPTION 2: Opposed Trial**  
Use when conflict is open and both players want active roles.
- First player resolves their Trial normally.
- Second player **immediately draws** their own tokens.
- Narrator weaves both outcomes into a single narrative.

### Tips for the Narrator

You’re the story’s director—balance risk, drama, and reward.

- **Set Difficulty** using the table, but adapt to your campaign’s tone. “Very Hard” (5 ⚫) should be rare and climactic.
- **Use Danger** to heighten tension—clarify what a Scene Exit means (temporary? narrative?). Avoid lethality unless it fits the story.
- **Apply Thematic Statuses** to reflect mental state or environment. Create custom ones for unique moments (e.g., “Exhaustion” during a long march).
- **Balance Complications & Afflictions**:  
  - **Complications** should propel the story (new obstacles).  
  - **Afflictions** should challenge—but not cripple—your heroes.  
  Collaborate to make consequences meaningful, not punitive.
- **Shared Narrative**: Encourage players to suggest scene details, but retain final say for coherence.

### Now It’s Your Turn ✨

You’ve read the rules. You understand the heart of the game: **risk, choice, shared storytelling**. You hold an elegant tool—white and black tokens, Traits, Lessons. But these pages aren’t a rigid manual. They’re a **map**, an **invitation**.

Don’t seek perfection. Seek **emotion**.  
Let complications surprise you.  
Let successes exhilarate you.  
Let afflictions shape you.

**New Beginning** doesn’t tell you what to do. It asks:  
> “**How much do you dare risk?**”

Every ⚪ you place in the bag is a piece of you, your hero, your story.  
Every ⚫ you draw is a chance to turn failure into drama, defeat into a new beginning.

The Narrator has their role. The players have theirs.  
But the story?  
**The story is born between you**—in the moment you decide how many tokens to draw, in the moment you accept an affliction because “yes, that fits my character,” in the moment someone says, “What if…?”

Now take your heroes, your bag, your courage—and begin.  
Your story is waiting.

> “It’s not the end. It’s just a new beginning.”
